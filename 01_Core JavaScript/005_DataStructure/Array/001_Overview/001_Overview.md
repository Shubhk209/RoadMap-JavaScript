# What is an Array in JavaScript?

**An array is a special variable in JavaScript that can hold more than one value at a time.**

- Unlike regular variables that store a single value, arrays can store a collection of values, each associated with a numerical index.

Arrays are ordered collections, meaning the items in an array are stored in a specific order. 
+ The first item is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on.

An array in JavaScript is a type of global object that is used to store data.

## Why Do We Need Arrays in JavaScript?

1. **Organize Data:** Arrays let us store multiple values in a single variable, making it easier to manage and manipulate data.
2. **Grouping Related Data:** They are useful for grouping related data, like a list of names, numbers, or objects.
3. **Efficient Data Handling:** Arrays allow for efficient data handling, enabling easy addition, removal, and access to data elements.
4. **Iteration:** We can loop through arrays to perform operations on each item, making them ideal for repetitive tasks.
