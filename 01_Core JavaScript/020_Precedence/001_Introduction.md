# Precedence

JavaScript's operator precedence decides how expressions with multiple operators get calculated.

- It sets the order for operations shaping the end result.

Think of a tricky math problem with lots of steps.

- Precedence tells you what to solve first – like multiplication before addition – to get the right answer.

## How precedence works:

- Operators with higher precedence get solved **before** those with lower precedence.
- When operators have equal precedence **associativity** (left-to-right or right-to-left) comes into play.
