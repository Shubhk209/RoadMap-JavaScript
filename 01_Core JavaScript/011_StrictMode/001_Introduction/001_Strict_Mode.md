# What is Strict Mode?

**New Feature introduce in ECMAScript 5 (ES5).**

**It is a way to make your code more secure and help you avoid common mistakes.**

- When you enable strict mode in your JavaScript code, the `JavaScript engine` **_applies stricter rules for parsing and executing your code_**.
