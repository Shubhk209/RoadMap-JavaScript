# Greater Than Or Equal To Operator

The greater than or equal to operator `>=` returns

- true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
- false if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.

```js
// left operand is greater
console.log(3 >= 2); // true

// both operands are equal
console.log(4 >= 4); // true

// left operand is smaller
console.log(2 >= 5); // false
```
