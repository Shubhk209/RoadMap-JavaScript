# Strict Equal To Operator

The strict equal to operator === evaluates to

- true if both the values and the types of the operands are the same.
- false if either the values or the types of the operands are not the same.

```js
// same value, same type
console.log(2 === 2); // true

// same value, different type
console.log(2 === "2"); // false
```

## Difference between the `==` and `===` operators.

The `==` (equality) operator only checks the values of the operands and not their types. For example,

However, the `===` (strict equality) operator checks both the values and types of the operands. For example,

```js
// only checks the values
console.log(2 == "2"); // true

// checks both the values and the types
console.log(2 === "2"); // false
```

- This means, the `==` operator returns true as long as the values of the operands are equal.
- But, the `===` operator only returns true when both the values and the types of the operands are equal.
