# Less Than Or Equal To Operator

The less than or equal to operator `<=` returns

- true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.
- false if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.

```js
// left operand is smaller
console.log(2 <= 5); // true

// both operands are equal
console.log(4 <= 4); // true

// left operand is greater
console.log(3 <= 2); // false
```
