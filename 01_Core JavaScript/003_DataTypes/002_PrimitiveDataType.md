# Primitive Datatype.

It refers to the `basic`, `indivisible` **units of data** that cannot be further broken down.

- These data types serve as the foundation upon which more complex data structures are built.
- They are analogous to the basic building blocks like bricks in a construction project, where each brick cannot be further divided while forming the foundation for larger structures.

> "Indivisible values" refers to the notion that **_primitive data types cannot be further broken down into smaller meaningful units_**.

**It is in relation to their `simplicity` and `immutability`.**

- Unlike more complex data types like objects and arrays, primitive data types `hold single`, `indivisible values` and their `values cannot be directly changed after creation`.
- Any modifications create a `new copy of the data`, maintaining the original value.
- This `immutability` makes them simpler to handle and reason about, like basic geometric shapes compared to intricate sculptures.

## Why is it called primitive?

**These data types represent the simplest and most fundamental forms of data within the language.**

- They lack the complexity and features of other data types, making them the foundational elements upon which more sophisticated data structures are built.
