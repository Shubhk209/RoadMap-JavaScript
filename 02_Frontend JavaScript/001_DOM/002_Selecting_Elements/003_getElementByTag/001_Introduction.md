# getElementsByTagName(tagName)

**It is a method used to retrieve a collection of elements from the Document Object Model (DOM) that share the same tag name.**

- It is a method of the document object or a specific DOM element.

- It accepts a tag name and returns a `live HTMLCollection` of elements with the matching tag name in the order in which they appear in the document.

> **Note**: Takes a single argument, tagName, which is a case-insensitive string representing the HTML tag name you want to select (e.g., "div", "p", "h1").

## Syntax

```javascript
var elements = document.getElementsByTagName(tagName);
```

- **tagName**: A string representing the name of the elements to be retrieved.

## Use Cases

1. **Several Element Manipulation**: If you want to perform some action on all elements of any particular type, like all `<p>` elements, then you may use getElementsByTagName to collect and process them.
2. **Form Processing**: You have a form with several input elements. You want to collect all input fields and process their values.
3. **Dynamic Content Updates**: This approach means you are able to update the content of a page dynamically and be confident you will reach the right kind of elements.

## Limitations

1. **Live Collection**: The HTMLCollection returned by `getElementsByTagName` is live, meaning that it will always reflect the current state of the document.
   - It may have performance implications as the document is being frequently modified.
2. **Lack of Specificity**: `getElementsByTagName` is not as specific as methods like querySelectorAll, which allows for more complex and precise selection of elements.
