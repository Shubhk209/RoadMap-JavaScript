# Comparison between `appendChild` and `append`

| **Feature**                      | **`appendChild`**                                             | **`append`**                                                    |

| **What It Does**                 | Adds one item (like a new element) to the end of a list.      | Adds one or more items (elements or text) to the end of a list. |
| **How Many Things You Can Add**  | Only one thing at a time.                                     | You can add several things at once.                             |
| **Adding Text**                  | You need to create a text node first if you want to add text. | You can add text directly without extra steps.                  |
| **If the Item Is Already There** | Moves the item if it’s already in the list.                   | Moves the item if it’s already in the list.                     |
| **What It Gives Back**           | Gives you back the item you added.                            | Doesn’t return anything.                                        |
| **Browser Support**              | Works in all modern browsers.                                 | Works in all modern browsers.                                   |
| **Easy Example**                 | `parent.appendChild(child);`                                  | `parent.append(child, 'Some text');`                            |
| **Types of Items**               | Only elements and text nodes.                                 | Elements, text, or a mix of both.                               |

So, `appendChild` is great for adding one thing at a time, while `append` is more flexible and allows you to add multiple things, including text, all at once.
