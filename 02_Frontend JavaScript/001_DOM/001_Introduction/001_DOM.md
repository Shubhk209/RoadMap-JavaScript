# What is Document Object Model (DOM)

It is an **application programming interface** (API) for manipulating HTML documents.

**The DOM represents an HTML document as a tree of nodes.**

- The DOM provides functions that allow you to add, remove, and modify parts of the document effectively.

> Note that the DOM is `cross-platform` and `language-independent` ways of manipulating HTML and XML documents.

## DOM Structure

1. **Document**: The `root node` of the DOM tree, representing the entire document.
2. **Element**: `Nodes` that represent HTML elements.
3. **Attribute**: `Nodes` that represent HTML attributes.
4. **Text**: `Nodes` that represent text within elements.

## A document as a hierarchy of nodes

The DOM represents an HTML document as a hierarchy of nodes.

**HTML**

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript DOM</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello DOM!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**The tree represents the above HTML document.**

<div>
<img src="../../000_images/DOM_Hierarchy.png" style="margin: 0px auto;"/>
</div>

- The `document` is the **root node** of the DOM tree.
- The **root node** has **one child node**, which is the `<html>` element.
- The `<html>` element is called the `document element`.
- Each document can have only one document element.
- In an HTML document, the document element is the `<html>` element.
- Each piece of markup can be represented by a **node** in the tree.
